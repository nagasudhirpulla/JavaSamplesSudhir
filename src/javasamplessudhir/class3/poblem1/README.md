## Java Concepts
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
5. Class
6. Object
7. Data hiding

*Encapsulation* means having both member variables and methods in the object.

Every object in Java implements Encapsulation


*Polymorphism* - Compile Time Polymorphism, Run Time Polymorphism

Compile Time Polymorphism examples - Function Overloading, Operator Overloading

Run Time Polymorphism examples - 


*Multiple Inheritance not allowed* in java. To facilitate multiple inheritance, we can use *Interfaces*


In a java class the declared *variables* are by default *private*

In a java class the declared *methods* are by default *public*

Every Class has a default constructor like <ClassName>()

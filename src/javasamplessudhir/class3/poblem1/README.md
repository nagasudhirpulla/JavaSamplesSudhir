## Java Concepts
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
5. Class
6. Object
7. Data hiding

**Encapsulation** means having both member variables and methods in the object.

Every object in Java implements Encapsulation


**Polymorphism** - Compile Time Polymorphism, Run Time Polymorphism

Compile Time Polymorphism examples - Function Overloading, Operator Overloading

Run Time Polymorphism examples - 


**Multiple Inheritance not allowed** in java. To facilitate multiple inheritance, we can use **Interfaces**


If no modifier (public, private, protected) is specified, 
a method or member variable is treated as **default**.

The method or member variables with default modifier 
are accessible only within package.

Every Class has a default constructor like ```<ClassName>()```
